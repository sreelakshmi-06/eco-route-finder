### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
Installation
Clone the Repository: Use Git to clone the project repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/eco-route.git
cd eco-route
Set Up a Virtual Environment: Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up the Database:

For SQLite: The database will be automatically created when running the app.
For MySQL: Update the database connection details in your configuration file (app.py or a separate config file):
python
Copy
Edit
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = "mysql+pymysql://username:password@localhost/database_name"
Migrate the Database: Use Flask-Migrate or SQLAlchemy to initialize the database:

bash
Copy
Edit
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade


# Run
Run the Application
Start the Flask Server: Run the application locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Access the Application: Open your browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:5000
Stop the Server: Press Ctrl + C in the terminal to stop the Flask development server.
